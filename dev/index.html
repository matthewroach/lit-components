					C'mon, c'mon let's go. I will. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it
					you could accomplish anything. No, Marty, we've already agreed that
					having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even
					if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever
					you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of
					time. Who are you?

					Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit
					here? Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't
					tonight the night of the big date? It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha,
					Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute
					behind mine, it's still ticking. Look me up when you get there, guess
					I'll be about 47. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've
					been waiting for all my life.
